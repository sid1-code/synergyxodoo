A complete React authentication application with routing, login, register, and protected dashboard functionality. Built to work both as a website and mobile app.

## Features

- ✅ React Router setup with protected routes
- ✅ Login page with form validation
- ✅ Register page with form validation
- ✅ JWT token storage in localStorage
- ✅ ProtectedRoute wrapper for authentication
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile compatibility
- ✅ Modern UI with gradient backgrounds
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Context-based authentication management

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Login.js          # Login form component
│   ├── Register.js       # Registration form component
│   ├── Dashboard.js      # Protected dashboard component
│   └── ProtectedRoute.js # Route protection wrapper
├── contexts/
│   └── AuthContext.js    # Authentication context and logic
├── App.js                # Main app with routing
├── App.css               # Global styles
└── index.js              # App entry point
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## API Endpoints

The app expects these backend endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/auth/verify` - Token verification (optional)

### Expected API Response Format

**Login/Register Response:**
```json
{
  "token": "jwt_token_here",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "name": "User Name",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Routes

- `/` - Redirects to login
- `/login` - Login page
- `/register` - Registration page
- `/dashboard` - Protected dashboard (requires authentication)

## Authentication Flow

1. User visits app → redirected to `/login`
2. User logs in → JWT token stored in localStorage
3. User redirected to `/dashboard`
4. Protected routes check authentication status
5. Logout clears token and redirects to login

## Mobile App Compatibility

The app is designed to work as both a website and mobile app:

- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly buttons and inputs
- Optimized for various screen sizes
- Can be wrapped in Cordova/PhoneGap or similar frameworks
- PWA-ready structure

## Customization

### Styling
- Modify `src/App.css` for custom styling
- Colors and gradients can be easily changed
- Responsive breakpoints are defined in CSS

### Authentication
- Update API endpoints in `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`
- Modify token storage mechanism if needed
- Add additional user fields as required

### Routes
- Add new routes in `src/App.js`
- Create new protected routes using `ProtectedRoute` wrapper
- Modify redirect logic as needed

## Development Notes

- Uses React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Implements Context API for state management
- Axios for HTTP requests
- React Router v6 for navigation
- CSS-only styling (no external UI libraries)

## Testing the App

Since this is a frontend-only implementation, you can test the authentication flow by:

1. Starting the development server
2. The app will attempt to call the backend APIs
3. For development, you can mock the API responses or set up a simple backend
4. The app handles API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

## Production Deployment

1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Deploy the `build` folder to your hosting service
3. Ensure your backend API is properly configured
4. Update API base URLs if needed for production

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
